# WebScraper
A automatic form submitter using selenium
This is a basic webscraping algorithm to input information online.
This is specifically designed for the kroger customer comments page
It will need modification to be used on other sites.
The webscraper also can't submit the information because
the kroger website doesn't allow automated responses but could work
on a webbrowser other than chrome.
